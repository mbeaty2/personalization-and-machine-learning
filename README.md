# Personalization and Machine Learning

This repository contains all assignments from the Personalization and Machine Learning Course completed during my Master's of Science in Data Sciencce and AI.

A full list of these assignments is as follows:
1. Assignment 1 Code as a Jupyter Notebook and Report as a PDF file. 
2. Assignment 2 Code as a Jypyter Notebook.
3. Assignment 3 Code as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Description

Within this repository are three assignments for the completion of the Personalization and Machine Learning course. As a requirement of hand-in, these assignments were completed within jupyter notebooks. 

Assignment 1 explores Spotipy and acquiring a simple list of song recommendations by using Top N and cosine similarity. This project has an accompanying report discussing the process and findings of the project. 

Assignment 2 looks at how to train a simple Dot Product model, along with the user embeddings and item embeddings of movie ratings using the Keras library. This uses an open-source movie ratings dataset made available by my course leaders. 

Assignment 3 uses seaborn, k-means clustering, and data analysis techniques to group and cluster the responses of a personality questionnaire. It seeks to determine relationships between the types of question responses and its corresponding personality, and to develop a model that can predict the personality of an individual based on their responses. 

This course also required the completion of a personalization and machine learning project, which has been moved to a separate repository available here: https://github.com/mbeaty2/book-to-song-generator

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Spotipy programming and account access
* An understanding of numpy and pandas
* An understanding of working with dataframes
* Keras library
* Pytorch
* Seaborn

### Installing

* Download and access the jupyter notebooks in your preferred code editor. These notebooks do not require large GPU's and should be possible to run on your local machine. 

### Executing program

* Download the necessary datasets. 
* Open the file in a code editor and connect to a code environment.
* Run each cell in the notebook. Should you want to make adjustments, be sure to save the file before continuing to run each cell. If there are issues, restart the kernel and re-run each cell.

## Help

There was not too much difficulty executing these proejcts. They stand as explorations of personalization and machine learning topics, as well as opportunities to build on and expand the capabilities of these systems. The notebooks themselves are quite thorough and easy to follow, but it is encouraged to have a deep understanding of keras, vector modeling, and basic data science techniques prior to embarking on this research.
